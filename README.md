# Welcome to my GitHub!

I am 21 years old, and I am actively looking for myself in IT. 

For the past few years I have been writing a backend in the Python. 
Sometimes I do front-end in the React.

I have a personal [Telegram channel](https://t.me/MarshalC) and a [website](https://marshal.by), 
where I post fascinating articles. My tasks for the next few years are 
learning English and dive into competitive programming.
