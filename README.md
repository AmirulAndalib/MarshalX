# Welcome to my GitHub!

I am 22 years old, and I am actively looking for myself in IT ✨

For the past few years I have been writing a backend in the Python. I have a development experience in Node.js. Sometimes I do front-end in the React.

I have a personal [Telegram channel](https://t.me/MarshalC) ([the second one](https://t.me/MarshalR)) and [a website](https://marshal.by/), where I post fascinating articles sometimes. My tasks for the next few years are to improve my English, prepare for algorithmic and system design interviews.
